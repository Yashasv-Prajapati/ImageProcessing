# Introduction
This repository includes projects such as:

1. JPEG Image Compression - DCT and Quantization
2. Image Compression using LZW encoding - Lossless Compression

# About folders
The folders contain several graphs and analysis that I did on compression of images. The graphs are plotted using matplotlib. There are also 2 reports on this analysis. One is for **JPEG Image Compression** and the other is **Image Compression using LZW encoding**. The reports are in pdf format.
