# Introduction
This repository includes several of my projects in Image Processing that I've made during my Bachleor's degree. Each Folder has it's own readme section, how to run and what it does.

# Projects
These are the list of projects that I've made in this repository.
1. Image Resizing - Nearest Neighbour and Bilinear Interpolation
2. Affine Transform - Warping
3. Histogram Matching - Histogram Equalization
4. Image Morphing - Triangulation
5. JPEG Image Compression - DCT and Quantization
6. Image Compression using LZW encoding - Lossless Compression

# About Folders

1. Playground - Not really much to look into this. This folder contains all the **testing** and playing around that I've done with the images and the libraries. 

2. Basic - This folder contains the basic projects that include, **resizing, affine transform, histogram matching**. These projects are the ones that I've done in my 3rd Semester of Bachelor's Degree.

3. Morphing - This folder contains the Image Morphing Project, **morphing** two images using **triangulation**.

4. Compression - This folder includes **JPEG Image Compression** and **Image Compression using LZW encoding**.

# Tools needed

1. Jupyter Notebook OR VSCode with Jupyter Notebook Extension OR Google Colab
2. Latest Version of Python

# Basic Steps to Run the Notebook
1. Make sure latest version of **python** is installed.
2. Make sure latest version of **jupyter notebook** is installed, or maybe you can use **VSCode** to run the notebook using **jupyter notebook extension**.
3. Configure your environment to run the notebook.
